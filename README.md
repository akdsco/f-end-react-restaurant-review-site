`Imaginary Portfolio Project`


[Foodie Bible - Restaurant Reviews](https://foodie-bible.herokuapp.com/)
=======================================

Creating an application prototype with ReactJS

* * *

### Client Request

Our users demand an application in which they will be able to browse a map and find restaurants around them. We will have 
our list of restaurants and would also like to have access to all restaurants listed on Google as well. App should display 
vital information like name, average review count, address, user reviews etc. We would also like to have an option to add new 
restaurants and user reviews to each restaurant. Can you create a prototype for us?

### Solution

I used `Semantic UI React` to create an initial user interface. Then I focused on implementing the main functionality, 
google map and list of restaurants. I used `ReactJS` to deliver this project because its performance is outstanding when 
compared with similar JS frameworks these days. Application uses Google API's to gather information about Restaurants. 
I made sure to create for any user; therefore, it's fully responsive and accessible from any device.
